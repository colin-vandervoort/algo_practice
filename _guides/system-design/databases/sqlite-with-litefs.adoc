LiteFS can be categorized as a PA/EL data store. Data is replicated asynchronously to follower nodes.

[quote,LiteFS Architecture Guarantees]
----
As with any async replication system, there's a window of time where transactions are only durable on the primary node and have not been replicated to a replica node. A catastrophic crash on the primary would cause these transactions to be lost. Typically, this window is subsecond as transactions can quickly be shuttled from the primary to the replicas.

Synchronous replication and time-bounded asynchronous replication is planned for future versions of LiteFS.
