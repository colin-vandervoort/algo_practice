= System Design Interview Guide

== Categories of System Design

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Design
* Frontend Design
* Product Design
* Infrastructure Design

There can be overlap between Product Design and the other system design categories.

== Process

. Understand the Problem / Collect Requirements (*5 minutes*)
* Functional Requirements (e.g. "YouTube allows users to upload videos")
* Non-Functional Requirements
** *Scale*
*** Daily Active Users (DAU)
** *Performance*
*** Latency
**** Examples
***** A chat app might have tight latency requirements that warrant the added complexity of using WebSockets.
*** Throughput
** Consistency
** Security
** Freshness

. High-Level Design (*15 minutes*)
* Get buy-in from interviewer
* Can use a top-down approach and start with the APIs, which establish a contract between the end users and the backend systems.
** Does the API satisfy all the requirements?
* Hash out the data model and schema
** Can defer defining the schema to the deep dive if this has high impact on the non-functional requirements.
** *Data access patterns*
** *Read/write ratio*
** *CAP theorem* / PACELC

. Design Deep Dive (*15 minutes*)
* For the top 2-3 issues:
.. Articulate the problem
.. Come up with at least two solutions
.. Discuss the trade-offs of the solutions
.. Pick a solution and discuss it with the interviewer
* Where should data be cached?

. Wrap Up (*5 minutes*)
* Does the design satisfy all of the requirements?

== Evaluation Criteria

. Problem Solving
. Solution Design
. Technical Excellence
. Communication
