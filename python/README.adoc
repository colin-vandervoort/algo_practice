= Python solutions and supporting tools

== Templating

There is a link:https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Cookiecutter]-based template for generating leetcode problem solutions, see the link:tools/cookiecutter-leetcode-problem/cookiecutter.json[config file].

This template should be used via the link:tools/lc_new_py.py[lc_new_py.py], which passed the parameters for the template and output locations to Cookiecutter.
