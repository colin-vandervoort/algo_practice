From the https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/[uv documentation on installing Python]:

[.excerpt]
----
If Python is already installed on your system, uv will detect and use it without configuration. However, uv can also install and manage Python versions. uv automatically installs missing Python versions as needed â€” you don't need to install Python to get started.
----

=== (optional) installing python via uv

[source, bash]
----
uv python install
----

See https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/ for more details.

=== Virtual environments via uv

[source, bash]
----
# creates a venv (if one does not already exist) and then activates it
uv venv
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml

# add a package
uv add sqlalchemy
----

== Running internal scripts and other python-based tools

=== Using uv

[source, bash]
----
# generate code for LeetCode solutions
uv run -- tools/cookiecutter_lc_py.py # Python
uv run -- tools/boilerplate_lc_go.py # Golang
uv run -- tools/boilerplate_lc_rust.py # Rust

# run all tests for Python solutions
uv run -- tools/pytest_solutions.py

# format Python source files
uv run -- ruff format
